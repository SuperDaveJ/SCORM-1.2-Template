If displayed on the fuselage, the marks must be horizontal on both sides between the trailing edge of the wing and the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer.</p><p>For fixed wing and rotorcraft aircraft, if the size of the area where the marks are applied allows, the marks must be 12 inches high. If the area does not permit 12-inch marks, the marks must be as large as practical. Gliders may display 3-inch marks.</p><p>AC 45-2 is a helpful reference in determining compliance with these requirements. Any noncompliance with the rules for registration marking is a reason for denial of the certificate unless an exemption to this rule has been granted by FAA Headquarters and the applicant is authorized to use that exemption.</p>";

Careful consideration should be given when the background is highly decorated, i.e. checkered.</p><p>The FAA registration number, typically referred to as the N-number, includes the nationality (N for U.S.) and the actual registration which includes the numbers and any suffix letters.  <p>";
