It is simply a U.S. manufactured aircraft coming home, and it must be researched to determine how it left. For example, you must determine if it has ever been issued an Airworthiness Certificate or an Export C of A. If it was issued only an Export C of A, it does not require U.S. registration and therefore it may not be found in EDRS. This research must be done to determine whether you are about to issue an original or recurrent certificate. </p>"

This could be the country of manufacture, or a third country with whom we have third party provisions in the bilateral agreement.</p><p>The CAA&#8217;s Export Airworthiness Approval must contain a statement from that CAA stating that the aircraft conforms to its U.S. type design and is in a condition for safe operation. This approval can be in the form of a statement on an Export C of A document, a statement on letterhead, or a statement in the aircraft logbook, so long as it is made by the CAA of the exporting country. That CAA finding&#47;statement constitutes the original certification of import aircraft in the U.S., which then makes the FAA issuance of the first Airworthiness Certificate a recurrent certification.</p>"
