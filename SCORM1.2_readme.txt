The SCORM1.2 folder has three templates: Course SCO, Module SCO, and Lesson SCO.

Course SCO

This template is actually a single module SCO (the course has only one module). The course has multiple lessons. 
The LMS will mark "completed" when all lessons are completed. "Force progression" is set to the lesson pages -- a user has to
finish all the interactions on the page before Next is activated. The course menu is not "force progression" -- a user
could select any lesson to start. Tracking/bookmark feature is set to course menu and each page.

The manifest file (imsmanifest.xml) packs all lessons and common assets together as a single course SCO package. 



Module SCO

The module SCO template is for multiple modules. Each module is a single SCO and has the same features as the Course SCO template. 
LMS would mark "completed" when one of the module is completed. There is no course completion. All modules share the following
common assets:

template (folder)
sysimages (folder)
styles (folder)
scripts (folder)
bottom_empty.htm
loadpage.htm
resources.htm
help.htm
glossary.htm

The manifest file (imsmanifest.xml) packs all modules and common assets together, making it "multiple-module" Module SCO package. 


Lesson SCO

The lesson SCO template is for multiple lessons. Each lesson is a single SCO. LMS marks "completed" when each lesson is 
completed. It also has bookmark feature for each page in the lesson. All the lessons share the following common assets:

template (folder)
sysimages (folder)
styles (folder)
scripts (folder)
bottom_empty.htm
loadpage.htm
resources.htm
help.htm
